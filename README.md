# Urgante - A Stochastic Generative Music App

**Urgante** is a music generation tool that uses stochastic processes and rules to create music. Implemented in Pure Data (Pd).

## Features

- **Stochastic Music Generation**: Uses probabilistic processes to produce unique musical patterns.
- **Rules-Based**: Defines musical structures and patterns to guide the generative process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need [Pure Data (Pd)](https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data) installed on your system.

### Dependencies

Urgante relies on third-party Pure Data externals and abstractions:

1. [Kollabs](https://github.com/m---w/kollabs)

2. [rjlib](https://github.com/rjdj/rjlib)

3. [Mr. Peach](https://github.com/pd-externals/mrpeach)

### Installation

1. Clone the Urgante repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fqfdev/Urgante_demo.git
    ```

2. Open `urgante.pd` in Pure Data.

3. From within the patch, open `urgante_GUI`.

4. Ensure all externals and abstractions load correctly. You should see the main interface.

### Usage
